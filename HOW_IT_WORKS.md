# How DataVoid Works

## ⚠️ Important: DataVoid Does NOT Auto-Delete Accounts

**DataVoid is a helper tool, not an automatic account deleter.**

### Why Can't It Auto-Delete?

Chrome extensions **cannot** automatically delete accounts because:

1. **Security**: Auto-deleting would require storing your passwords, which is a major security risk
2. **Authentication**: Each website has different login systems and deletion processes
3. **Confirmation**: Most sites require you to confirm deletion yourself
4. **Legal**: Automatic deletion could violate terms of service

### What DataVoid DOES Do

✅ **Discovers Accounts**: Scans your browser history to find accounts you've created  
✅ **Shows Deletion Guides**: Opens direct links to deletion pages (when available)  
✅ **Searches Instructions**: Finds deletion instructions for services not in our database  
✅ **Helps You Delete**: Guides you through the deletion process  

### How the "How to Delete" Button Works

When you click **"🗑️ How to Delete"**:

1. **Confirmation Dialog** appears explaining what will happen
2. **If you click OK**:
   - For services in our database (Facebook, Twitter, etc.): Opens the **direct deletion page**
   - For other services: Opens a **Google search** with deletion instructions
3. **You then**:
   - Log into your account (if not already logged in)
   - Follow the deletion steps on that website
   - Confirm the deletion yourself

### Example Flow

**For Facebook (in database):**
1. Click "How to Delete" → Confirmation dialog
2. Click OK → Opens Facebook's account deletion page
3. You log in and delete your account on Facebook's website

**For UCLA (not in database):**
1. Click "How to Delete" → Confirmation dialog  
2. Click OK → Opens Google search with instructions
3. You find the instructions and contact UCLA to delete

### Why This Design?

This is the **correct and secure** way to handle account deletion:
- ✅ No password storage required
- ✅ You maintain full control
- ✅ Works with any website
- ✅ Follows security best practices
- ✅ Respects website terms of service

### What DataVoid Helps With

- 🔍 **Finding** old accounts you forgot about
- 📋 **Organizing** accounts with tags (Keep/Delete/Review)
- 🔗 **Linking** directly to deletion pages when available
- 📚 **Searching** for deletion instructions when needed
- 📊 **Tracking** which accounts you've reviewed

### Think of DataVoid As...

- A **personal assistant** that finds your old accounts
- A **directory** of deletion links
- A **search tool** for deletion instructions
- A **organizer** for your account cleanup process

**But NOT:**
- ❌ An automatic account deleter
- ❌ A password manager
- ❌ A bot that deletes accounts for you

---

**Bottom Line**: DataVoid helps you **find and organize** accounts, then **guides you** to delete them yourself. This is the secure and correct approach! 🔒
